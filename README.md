# Recorder Plugin Starter

This Unity package demonstrates a bare-bones
[Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.recorder.html) plugin.
Given a tagged camera and output dimensions, it saves a PNG image sequence.

This isn't useful on its own â€” Recorder already supports creating an image
sequence, and with far more control over the end result. Rather, you can use
this as a starting point for your own Recorder plugin that produces more
specialized output.
